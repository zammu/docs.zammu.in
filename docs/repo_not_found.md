# Repository not found Error

If you get a repository is not found error while trying to add a new site, it
may be because you are trying to add a private GitHub repository. By default we
only get access to your public repositories on GitHub. If you'd like to add a
private repository follow these steps:

### 1. Go to the identities page and click on 'Revoke my Github access' button

### 3. In GitHub authorize the access
